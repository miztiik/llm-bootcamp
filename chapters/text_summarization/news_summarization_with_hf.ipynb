    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a text document while still preserving the most important information. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as quickly skimming a long document, getting the gist of an article, or sharing a summary with others. LLMs can be used to create summaries of news articles, research papers, technical documents, and other types of text.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Chunking Strategies for LLM Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stuffing method** - The `stuffing` method is the easiest way to summarize text by feeding the entire document to a large language model (LLM) in a single call. This method has both pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Pros**:\n",
    "    - Only required a single call to the model, which can be faster than other methods that require multiple calls\n",
    "    - When summarizing text, the model has access to all the data at once, which can result in a better summary.\n",
    "  - **Cons**:\n",
    "    - Most models have a context length, and for large documents (or many documents) this will not work as it will result in a prompt larger than the context length.\n",
    "    - This method only works on smaller pieces of data and not suitable to large documents most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MapReduce method** - It is a technique for summarizing large pieces of text by first summarizing smaller chunks of text and then combining those summaries into a single summary. The `MapReduce` method implements a multi-stage summarization. In LangChain, you can use `MapReduceDocumentsChain` as part of the `load_summarize_chain` method. What you need to do is setting `map_reduce` as `chain_type` of your chain.\n",
    "  - MapReduce with Overlapping Chunks method\n",
    "  - MapReduce with Rolling Summary method\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/miztiik_automation_docs_copilot_using_llm_rag_02.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we do not know the length of the document, we will use the `map-reduce` method to summarize the news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will try fetch the latest Google news using server API and use AI-generated summaries with LangChain LLM framework or huggingface transformers.\n",

      "The chief executives of tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have advocated for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in various industries, including against cybercrimes. As concerns over the use of AI technology in cyber crimes grow, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that rapid developments in AI may help strengthen defences against security threats.“We are right to be worried about the impact on cybersecurity. But AI, I think actually, counterintuitively, strengthens our defense on cybersecurity ,” Pichai said at the Munich Security Conference last week.He noted that intelligence tools can be deployed to help governments as well as organisations to speed up the detection of and response to threats from hackers.His comments came as there has been a reported uptick in cybersecurity attacks in terms of sophistication and volumes. As per cyber research firm Cybersecurity Ventures, cyberattacks cost the global economy an estimated $8 trillion in 2023.However, Pichai pointed out that AI was also lowering the time needed for defenders to detect attacks and react against them.“AI disproportionately helps the people defending because you’re getting a tool which can impact it at scale versus the people who are trying to exploit,” he said, adding that the reduced time essentially means that cyberhackers can will have to be successful just once to attack a system whereas a defender has to be successful every time in order to protect it.“So, in some ways, we are winning the race,” he added.Pichai noted that AI tools are being put to use in the company’s products, such as Google Chrome and Gmail, as well as its internal systems.\"\n",

      "The chief executives of tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI have advocated for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in various industries, including against cybercrimes. As concerns over the use of AI technology in cyber crimes grow, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has said that rapid developments in AI may help strengthen defences against security threats.“We are right to be worried about the impact on cybersecurity. But AI, I think actually, counterintuitively, strengthens our defense on cybersecurity ,” Pichai said at the Munich Security Conference last week.He noted that intelligence tools can be deployed to help governments as well as organisations to speed up the detection of and response to threats from hackers.His comments came as there has been a reported uptick in cybersecurity attacks in terms of sophistication and volumes. As per cyber research firm Cybersecurity Ventures, cyberattacks cost the global economy an estimated $8 trillion in 2023.However, Pichai pointed out that AI was also lowering the time needed for defenders to detect attacks and react against them.“AI disproportionately helps the people defending because you’re getting a tool which can impact it at scale versus the people who are trying to exploit,” he said, adding that the reduced time essentially means that cyberhackers can will have to be successful just once to attack a system whereas a defender has to be successful every time in order to protect it.“So, in some ways, we are winning the race,” he added.Pichai noted that AI tools are being put to use in the company’s products, such as Google Chrome and Gmail, as well as its internal systems.\"\n",
