    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a text document while still preserving the most important information. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as quickly skimming a long document, getting the gist of an article, or sharing a summary with others. LLMs can be used to create summaries of news articles, research papers, technical documents, and other types of text.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Chunking Strategies for LLM Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stuffing method** - The `stuffing` method is the easiest way to summarize text by feeding the entire document to a large language model (LLM) in a single call. This method has both pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Pros**:\n",
    "    - Only required a single call to the model, which can be faster than other methods that require multiple calls\n",
    "    - When summarizing text, the model has access to all the data at once, which can result in a better summary.\n",
    "  - **Cons**:\n",
    "    - Most models have a context length, and for large documents (or many documents) this will not work as it will result in a prompt larger than the context length.\n",
    "    - This method only works on smaller pieces of data and not suitable to large documents most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MapReduce method** - It is a technique for summarizing large pieces of text by first summarizing smaller chunks of text and then combining those summaries into a single summary. The `MapReduce` method implements a multi-stage summarization. In LangChain, you can use `MapReduceDocumentsChain` as part of the `load_summarize_chain` method. What you need to do is setting `map_reduce` as `chain_type` of your chain.\n",
    "  - MapReduce with Overlapping Chunks method\n",
    "  - MapReduce with Rolling Summary method\n",
    "\n",
    "  <img src=\"images/miztiik_automation_docs_copilot_using_llm_rag_02.png\" width=\"50%\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we do not know the length of the document, we will use the `map-reduce` method to summarize the news articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will try fetch the latest Google news using server API and use AI-generated summaries with LangChain LLM framework or huggingface transformers.\n",

      "\"SAO PAULO: Medium-term global growth prospects are the weakest in decades, but G20 major economies could boost growth prospects if they work together to address climate change , avoid trade restrictions and adopt worldwide principles for artificial intelligence (AI), the International Monetary Fund said. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva urged G20 major economies to \"act boldly\" to rebuild policy momentum on reforms after years of \"firefighting\" in the wake of economic shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.With global growth expected to reach 3.1% in 2024, inflation falling and job markets holding up, policymakers could now focus on rebuilding fiscal buffers against future shocks, boosting domestic revenues, curbing the rise of public debt and ensuring that trends such as AI improve growth prospects, she said in a blog published on Monday to accompany an IMF report to the G20.Georgieva, who will address G20 finance officials when they meet in Sao Paulo this week, said low global growth affected all countries, but had \"particularly troubling\" implications for emerging markets and developing economies, which have weathered successive global shocks but continue to lag behind advanced economies.She said it was vital for countries to continue to work to broaden their tax base, close loopholes and improve tax administration, noting that the G20 had asked the IMF and World Bank to launch a joint initiative on the issue.The IMF report said it was now expected to take 130 years for emerging markets and developing economies to close half the gap in income per capita with advanced economies, up from around 80 years before the 2008 global financial crisis.Brazil, this year's president of the G20, has made ending inequality and addressing climate change a top priority.Given the recent improvement in the near-term outlook, with a \"soft landing\" now in sight, G20 policymakers could set \"their sights on a more equitable, prosperous, sustainable, and cooperative future,\" Georgieva said.She also said central banks should track inflation carefully and avoid easing monetary policy too soon or too fast.The IMF said medium-term growth prospects remain tepid due to weak productivity growth, aging, fragmentation and climate vulnerabilities, but there are still growth opportunities from trade in digital services, and AI, if properly harnessed.It said G20 leaders should step up efforts to tap Africa's growth potential and enable greater investments in education, health, and gender equality, and ensure greater coordination on debt restructuring for countries unable to make payments.Cooperation by the G20, including through carbon pricing, reduced energy subsidies and border carbon adjustment mechanisms, could also help mitigate the effects of climate change and facilitate the green energy transition, the IMF said.It called on them to work together to ensure the responsible use of AI, including by upgrading domestic regulatory frameworks and harmonizing global principles for its use.\"\n",
