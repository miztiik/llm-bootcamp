    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Text summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a text document while still preserving the most important information. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as quickly skimming a long document, getting the gist of an article, or sharing a summary with others. LLMs can be used to create summaries of news articles, research papers, technical documents, and other types of text.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Stuffing method** - The `stuffing` method is the easiest way to summarize text by feeding the entire document to a large language model (LLM) in a single call. This method has both pros and cons.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Pros**:\n",
    "    - Only required a single call to the model, which can be faster than other methods that require multiple calls\n",
    "    - When summarizing text, the model has access to all the data at once, which can result in a better summary.\n",
    "  - **Cons**:\n",
    "    - Most models have a context length, and for large documents (or many documents) this will not work as it will result in a prompt larger than the context length.\n",
    "    - This method only works on smaller pieces of data and not suitable to large documents most of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MapReduce method** - It is a technique for summarizing large pieces of text by first summarizing smaller chunks of text and then combining those summaries into a single summary. The `MapReduce` method implements a multi-stage summarization. In LangChain, you can use `MapReduceDocumentsChain` as part of the `load_summarize_chain` method. What you need to do is setting `map_reduce` as `chain_type` of your chain.\n",
    "  - MapReduce with Overlapping Chunks method\n",
    "  - MapReduce with Rolling Summary method\n",

    "As we do not know the length of the document, we will use the `map-reduce` method to summarize the news articles.\n",

This decision, while not affecting the upcoming election, is seen as a step towards more transparency and accountability in campaign finance. The ruling party has used this system to raise large sums of money, giving them an advantage in elections and suppressing opposition voices.

The system, introduced in 2017 by Prime Minister Modi's party, has been criticized for being undemocratic. The court has ordered the government bank to stop issuing these bonds and disclose donation details to the Election Commission. This ruling is seen as a blow to Modi's party, which has received over $1.9 billion from anonymous donors. Only parties with at least 1% of votes in previous elections were eligible to receive these bonds.\u001b[0m\n",
